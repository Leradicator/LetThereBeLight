    The aim of this document is to challenge the common fact within the
    mathematical world claiming that $\mathbb{C}$ is as complete as we
    would think about it. This paper does not deny any commonly known
    properties of the set such that ``$\mathbb{C}$ is an algebraic closure
    of $\mathbb{R}$'' but rather blame the mathematic community for not
    trying to extend this set and account for solving problems like the
    following equation,
    $$ z^{*}z = -1 $$
    and their interest in widening the range of possibilities in modern
    daily life mathematics.

\section{Introduction}
While maintaining the consistency of the complex plane, we wish to introduce
an innovative approach to construct a set that solves for equations of the type,

\begin{equation}
    z^{*}z = -1 
\end{equation}

where $^{*}$ denotes the conjugation sign known in $\mathbb{C}\ as\ (a+ib)^{*} = (a-ib)$.
We will first briefly discuss the assumptions that denote the set that contains
solutions to the equation $(1)$, assumptions which are regarded as axiomatic definitions.

\begin{definition}
    Let there be $\mathbb{L}$ such that $(1)$ admits at least one solution,
    $l \in \mathbb{L}$

    Following are a list of assumptions that hopefully characterize the set $\mathbb{L}$
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\mathbb{C}\ \subset\ \mathbb{L}$
        \item $(\mathbb{L},+,.)$ is a vector space over the field $\mathbb{C}$
        \item $(\mathbb{L},+,\cdot)$ is a field
        \item The conjugation operator $^{*}$ keeps the same known qualities:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item distributivity over $+$: $(a+b)^{*}=a^{*}+b^{*}$
                \item distributivity over $\cdot$: $(a \cdot b)^{*} = a^{*}\cdot b^{*}$
                \item ivolutivity: $a^{**} = a$
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}
    From the above $1.3$ it follows that equation $(1)$ does not admit
    a unique solution. There are in fact infinitely many:
    $$\forall \phi \in \mathbb{R}, (e^{i\phi}\cdot l)^{*}\cdot (e^{i\phi}\cdot l) = -1 $$
    $$\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}, (l^{2n+1})^{*}\cdot (l^{2n+1}) = -1 $$

    A justification for the second clause follows from the following result of $1.1$
    that is, ``$l$ is not a zero of any element of $\mathbb{C}[X]$''. Otherwise,
    $l$ would be in $\mathbb{C}$\\
    For similar reasons, the following property holds as well:
    $$ l^{*} \neq l $$ 
\end{proposition}

\section{Announcing the traits of the set}
Following our introduction, we want to discuss some traits of the set
$\mathbb{L}$ in the following section and show some properties that do not
need formal proofs in that they are easy to understand.\\
First, let us witness from $Proposition\ 1$ and earlier results that $l$
is not distinguishable from any of its odd powers, nor of its phases with
respect to equation $(1)$. We will further see to it that we solve $(1)$ in
$\mathbb{L}$ and derive the solutions for equations of the type $y^{*}y = x$
with generic values of $x$, yet being open to complete $\mathbb{L}$ in that aspect if needed.
Regarding the dimensionality of $\mathbb{L}$ being a field as well as a $\mathbb{C}$ vector space,
we can derive from the above results that $(l^{n})_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}$ is a linearly independent family.
Thus $\mathbb{L}$ is infinite-dimensional. $\mathbb{C}$ being algebraically closed, together with the
assumed field structure of $\mathbb{L}$ guarantees that property.

\section{\LaTeX}
Use sectioning commands for headings. Often longer articles are divided into a few sections.


\LaTeX knows that a new paragraph has started if you skip a line in the input file.
It will automatically indent the proper amount.

You must use labelling commands, e.g. \verb2\label2, \verb2\ref2,
\verb2\bibitem2, and \verb2\cite2, to refer to sections of your document, such as
see Section~\ref{AbelSection}, see Figure~\ref{SelfdualFig}, or bibliography entries,
such as see~\cite{MyFavorite}.  Otherwise the look of the numbers, and sometimes the numbers
themselves, will be wrong in the final version at the printer.

\section{Abel's Theorem}\label{AbelSection}
     In this section we give some background.  For instance
the following definition.

\begin{definition}
     A {\em semi-quaver} is defined to be half a quaver.
\end{definition}

If that definition is not enough, here is another:

\begin{definition}
    The {\em order} of a note $n$ in a quaver $Q$,
    $O(n,Q)$, is defined by the equation
         $$ O(n,Q) = \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(n^{2} t)/(1-Qn) dt. $$
\end{definition}

Some equations one writes inline, such as
{\em Pythagoras' Theorem,}
$c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2}$,
while others are better off as displayed
equations, like the quadratic formula,
  $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}$$
which solves the quadratic $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$. If the quadratic
formula is written inline,
  $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}$,
it is readable but not very nice.
This form,
  $x = (-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac})/2a$,
is harder to read as a fraction, but better because of the larger type.

Every inline equation must be part of a sentence:  Since $x < 1/2$ we have
$x + y < x + 1/2$.  Inline fractions, such as $x < \frac{1}{2}$, are discouraged but
not prohibited.


You can use formulae in theorems, as in the following.

\begin{theorem}\label{ContThrm}
    If $f(x)$ is defined by the equation
    \begin{equation}\label{SplitFunc}
         f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
                          x^{2}, & \mbox{~for $x \geq 0$.} \\
                         -x^{2}, & \mbox{~for $x < 0$}
                         \end{array} \right.
   \end{equation}
   Then $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
    Since
          $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^{-}} f(x) =
           \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^{-}} -x^{2} = 0$
    and
          $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^{+}} f(x) =
           \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^{+}} x^{2} = 0$
    it follows that
         $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x) = 0 = f(x)$,
         as required.
\end{proof}





   Did you notice the grammatical error in
   Theorem~\ref{ContThrm}?  The sentence leading
   into equation~\ref{SplitFunc} is never completed.
   %%%% Notice references are done with \ref
   %%%% you can label any structure that produces a number
   The following
   theorem is worded correctly.
\begin{theorem}
    If $f(x)$ is defined by the equation
    \begin{equation}
         f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
                          x^{2}, & \mbox{~for $x \geq 0$} \\
                         -x^{2}, & \mbox{~for $x < 0$}
                         \end{array}\right.,
   \end{equation}
   then $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$.
\end{theorem}

   One rule of thumb of mathematical composition is to
   use mathematical notation inside sentences only for
   nouns.  For example, one writes that ``$R$ is the the
   radius of a circle'', but not that ``the radius of the
   circle ='s the side length of the square''.  According to
   this rule it is correct to write that
   ``$(x>0) \Rightarrow (x^{3} > 0)$'' since the double arrow is part of
   an equation, but not to write
   ``$x$ is positive $\Rightarrow$ $x^{3}$ is positive'', since the
   double arrow is acting as a verb.

Here is another kind of common structure:

\begin{theorem}
   The following are equivalent.
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item $a \leq b$
      \item $b \geq a$
      \item $a = b$ or $a<b$
   \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

And here is a typical matrix
 $$
 \left[
 \begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
    0 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
    0 & 0 & \alpha & \alpha & -\alpha & -\alpha & 0 & 0  \\
    \alpha & \alpha & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\alpha & -\alpha  \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0  \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -1
 \end{array}
 \right]
 $$


Sometimes you want to use a figure.

              order~4\label{SelfdualFig}}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{SelfdualFig} was made (using TeXCad)
with the \LaTeX picture
environment.  Sometimes a figure is just too
complicated to draw with these simple commands.  In this case
we use epsf files.
For instance in Figure~\ref{ParabFig} the picture of the
parabola was produced in Maple
and saved as an epsf (eps) file, (pure ascii mode, no
preview, no thumbnail).
  \begin{figure}[htb]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{para01.eps}
      \caption{$y = x^{2}$\label{ParabFig}}
  \end{figure}
When the document is processed, the .eps file must reside
in the same directory as the .tex file.  Also, the command
\verb2\usepackage{graphicx}2 should occur near the top of the document.
Notice that this figure has been scaled so that the overall size
is convenient (width 2.5 inches), but now the text is far too small.
To avoid this problem it is often best to
generate a figure which is approximately the same size as
it will appear in the document.

A complete source of information on writing documents
in \LaTeX is~\cite{MyFavorite}.  (Look in the source
so see how to produce that citation.)
Last of all is the style of the $\Pi$ME biliography:
Author's names in small caps, journal article titles
uncapitalized and in italics, book titles capitalized
and in quotes.
